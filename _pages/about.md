I am a Ph.D. student majoring in statistics at Beijing Normal University. My research interest mainly lies in **causal inference** and **precision medicine**. I stay curious about all related areas of statistics. I look forward to learning more about new things, especially machine learning and semiparametric theory. Always welcome comments and collaborations!
