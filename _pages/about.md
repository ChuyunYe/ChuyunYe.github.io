I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Beijing Normal University. My research interests primarily lie in **causal inference** and **precision medicine**. I remain curious about all areas related to statistics and look forward to exploring new topics, especially machine learning and semiparametric theory. Always welcome comments and collaborations!
